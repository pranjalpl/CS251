\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Execution Time for each sample of 1 Thread}
 \includegraphics{scatter1.eps}
 \floatfoot{For Small input size the execution time of single thread is better than that of Multithread but it increases for large input.}
 \end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Execution Time for each sample of 2 Threads}
 \includegraphics{scatter2.eps}
  \floatfoot{For Small input size the execution time of 2 threaded is same as that of Single thread but it performs slightly better for large input.}
 \end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Execution Time for each sample of 4 Threads}
 \includegraphics{scatter3.eps}
  \floatfoot{For Small input size 4 threads perform worse than single and double threads but performs significantly better for large inputs.}
 \end{figure}
 
\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Execution Time for each sample of 8 Threads}
 \includegraphics{scatter4.eps}
  \floatfoot{For Small input size 8 threads perform worse than single threads and for large inputs it performs worse than 4 threads.}
 \end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Execution Time for each sample of 16 Threads}
 \includegraphics{scatter5.eps}
  \floatfoot{Performance for 16 threads is almost same as performance for 8 threads.}
 \end{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \caption{Number of Elements vs Average Execution Time for each Number of Threads}
 \includegraphics{avg.eps}
  \floatfoot{For Larger number of threads the growth of execution time is slower, but it is best for 4 Threads.}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{figure}
 \caption{Average Speedup for each Thread Configuration}
 \includegraphics{speedup.eps}
  \floatfoot{Speedup is greater for greater Number of Elements.}
 \end{figure}

 \begin{figure}
 \caption{Variance of 100 Samples for each Thread Configuration}
 \includegraphics{error.eps}
  \floatfoot{Error is greater for greater Number of Elements.}
